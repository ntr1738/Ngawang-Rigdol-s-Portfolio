This project visualizes constructive and destructive interference patterns of light waves in 3D using Python and Matplotlib. Used Python, Matplotlib (3D plotting), NumPy (math operations) and Pandas (dataframes).

-3D Surface Plots: Simulates individual and combined light 
  waveforms using sinusoidal functions.

-Constructive Interference: Demonstrates how two waves with 
  the same phase amplify each other.

-Destructive Interference: Shows how waves with opposite 
  phases cancel out.

-Parametric Control: Adjust parameters like amplitude, 
 wavelength, phase difference, and more.

-Dynamic DataFrames: Uses pandas to tabulate and analyze 
  wave characteristics.

-"Super Wave" Generator: Calculates and visualizes a mean- 
  based wave from combined data.

Physics Behind It:

-Wave equation: z = A * sin(kx - wt - φ)

-Variables like amplitude (A), wavelength (λ), frequency (f), 
 angular frequency (ω), wave number (k), and phase (φ) are all 
 customizable.

-The code simulates light with a wavelength of 450 nm (blue 
  light) and combines waves with varying phase differences (0, π, 
  2π).
